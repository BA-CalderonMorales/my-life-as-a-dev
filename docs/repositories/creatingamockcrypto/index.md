# Creating_A_Mock_Crypto

The Reddit user also linked the repository where they found the code to create a mock crypto currency. Here is the link to the Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/f0qd3y/how_to_create_your_own_cryptocurrency_using/. Here is the link to the GitHub repository mentioned in the Reddit post: https://github.com/Alfrick/Create-Cryptocurrency-in-Python.git. Many props to both the original reddit poster for their detailed explanations in the post, and the code that was originally created by Alfrick Opidi. 

## Here is a snippet of the output from running the program as of 9/3/2021

One thing I'll mention, the reddit user posted this about a year ago and the GitHub repository hasn't had an update to it in 14 months. The code in this repository and the one that is in Alfrick Opidi's should be used for educational purposes and for understanding how the code is being processed inside of a cryptocurrency. Like I said, I'll be making modifications to my code as time goes by to try and apply 2021 concepts to it. My thoughts are currently around trying to apply concepts such as Proof of Stake to it.

# Differences between Proof of Stake and Proof of Work:

Proof of Work:
____
  1. To add each block to the chain, miners mmust compete to solve a difficult puzzle using their computers processing power.
  2. In order to add a malicious block, you'd have to have a computer more powerful than 51% of the network.
  3. The first miner to solve the puzzle is given a reward for their work.

Proof of Stake:
____
  1. There is no competition as the block creator is chosen by an algorithm based on the user's stake.
  2. In order to add a malicious block, you'd have to own 51% of all the cryptocurrency on the network.
  3. There is no reward for making a block, so the block creator takes a transaction fee.
