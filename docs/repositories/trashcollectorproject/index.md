# TrashCollector
Django, SQL, HTML/CSS, Python technologies used for creating this CRUD app. If you download the PyCharm code, you'll 
need to make sure that you have you're own database to go along with this site. It uses MySQL to run and it's
currently relying on the backend server that I built on my computer to output the data that you see below.
### A recent bug I ran into that was resolved by looking into this website:<br> https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=103355
It had to do with the version of mysql-connector that I was using. I simply used the 8.0.24 version, and the site
is functional once again.
## Here are some snippets of the site
