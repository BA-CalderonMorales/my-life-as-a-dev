## Personal Portfolio

![Portfolio Website](https://i.ibb.co/WgPMpts/image.png)

This is my portfolio website as a junior software engineer.
Please feel free to fork my repo or clone it to use as your own.
I'm for helping the community, as I was not the sole person
who created the code for my portfolio site. As a community,
programmers should always vow to help one another for the
purpose of helping each other and our craft prosper.

Feel free to reach out in case you don't understand why I did
something somewhere in this repo.

PSA: I'm in the works of creating a link to my updated
portfolio site in the coming weeks.


_It's been a while since this repo was updated._
