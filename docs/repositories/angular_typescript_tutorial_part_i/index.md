<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

</div>

<p>
 In the first part of this tutorial project, I learned how Angular CLI is set up, along with how to search through the Angular.io website 
 in order to search for the specific things that I am looking for in order to learn how to use a variety of different tools that the framework 
 has to offer. To see a breakdown of what this covers, you can look at the YouTube link in the Acknowledgments section of this README, where the YouTube content creator: Awais Mirza breaks 
 down how to use Angular in 2021. I only put a little bit of a twist from what his three hour tutorial went over, mostly because I already have 
 experience using frontend frameworks (i.e. React). The second part of this tutorial covers Routing, and I'll be sure to post that on GitHub 
 as soon as I finish with it.
</p>

<p>
 Along with learning about how to use Angular's CLI, the first part of his tutorial also showed me everything that had to do with making api calls, 
 using directives to handle different class names pertaining to different tags, how to bind variables to a components html page, as well as looking 
 into how to use two-way and property binding correctly. I really enjoyed seeing how Angular does these things, but also how the framework handles 
 conditional rendering, as well as how to loop through arrays and arrays of objects. Although there are a few similarities, so far, Angular is proving 
 to be quite different from React.

## Angular ReadMe setup. Actual set up to come upon project completion.

# Myapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
