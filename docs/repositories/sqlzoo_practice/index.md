# repo_SQLZOO
This is just a notebook where I'll refer back to and see what I answered in my SQL Zoo answers. Please go to the SQL website in case you want to try out some of my answers or you can use this as a answer checker for what's currently on there. It may change with time, and if it does, then this will become more of a notebook than an answer sheet. Will still serve as a good reference for me or anyone who chooses to stop by this repository.
