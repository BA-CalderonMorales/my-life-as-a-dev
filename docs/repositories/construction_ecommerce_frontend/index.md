<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62074841/133553190-8c144cd8-54b0-4ce3-8ee4-80299ea70f98.png)

<p>
 I built this during a 10-day coding sprint while still a student at DevCodeCamp. It was an eye-opening experience having
 to code this bad boy out during that short amount of time, but I'm really proud of the end-product. It's meant to be a web 
 application that's used to help small business construction owners manage their client intake, and handle the countless 
 project proposals that may come flooding in if they're a good company. It's also meant to serve as a place where the 
 owner of the company can showcase their projects to other potential clients and allow people to view new projects being 
 updloaded to the site in real time. There is a bit more functionality to this, so please feel free to view this video 
 that highlights what some of the key features were with regarding this specific, ecommerce application.

5. "cd" into the server folder in the other terminal.
6. npm start in both the client and server folder.
7. Give it a moment and the project will start up.
8. In the mean-time, go to the ASP.NET Core Entity Framework backend that I built for this project by following this link: <a href="https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/Construction-Ecommerce-Backend">Construction Ecommerce Backend Repository</a>
9. Open up the sln file inside of the backend repo that you just downloaded.
