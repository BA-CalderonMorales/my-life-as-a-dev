## Purpose

This repository serves as a central source of truth for:
- Reusable GitHub Actions workflows
- Common automation scripts
- Standardized issue and PR templates
- Documentation for workflow and script usage

## Current Workflows

The workflows in this repository are designed to be called from other repositories using the `@main` reference. This ensures consistent automation across all related projects.

### Core Workflows

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Repository initialization
   - Dependencies installation
   - Environment validation

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Code linting
   - Testing
   - Security scanning

## Usage

To use these workflows in your repository, reference them using:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: yourusername/dev-environment-workflows/.github/workflows/workflow-name.yml@main
```

## Scripts

The `/github/scripts` directory contains various utility scripts that support the workflows:

- Environment setup scripts
- Validation utilities
- Common operations scripts

## Contributing

### Adding New Workflows

1. Create a new workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive documentation
4. Test the workflow in isolation
5. Submit a PR with the changes

### Modifying Existing Workflows

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make necessary changes
3. Test the changes against a test repository
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Submit a PR with the changes

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Expand workflow templates for different project types
- [ ] Add support for container-based workflows
- [ ] Implement advanced security scanning
- [ ] Create workflow visualization and documentation tools
