<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62074841/133553325-a9263dc7-1cd0-4e4f-aa12-99ade948baba.png)

<p>
 There is this YouTube channel called JavaScript Mastery. Their content is literally gold to developers world-wide. 
 I follow the channel pretty religiously nowadays, and like to practice things that they do on it, and also try to 
 implement their projects to work more optimally wherever I can make it function better. In this project, I found 
 out how to link Firebase with my web application to allow for user authentication to sign in using Google OAuth, 
 which was pretty stinking sweet. I'm going to be implementing this chat app wherever I see the need in future 
 projects, but the fact that I learned how to use Firebase with it really was the cherry on top for me. If you'd 
 like to see the original creator of this code, please see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv9Js3QLOLY&list=RDCMUCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A&index=2 ">link</a>. DISCLAIMER: By no means did I just fork the code to call it my own. Nope. I simply followed along, 
 every single step of his tutorial. Like I said, his tutorials are literally gold to developers world-wide, and 
 they're basically teaching things on his channel that I never learned at my coding bootcamp or in college.
