<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62074841/133553261-6c903f99-f6c5-405c-ba9a-e50e3380786a.png)

<p>
 In this project, I took on making the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock game from Big Bang Theory. It's using 
 Visual Studio and the console within the IDE to prompt commands to a user playing the game to input specific gestures 
 against either a bot or another player. It was really fun replicating this game in C#, and I really enjoyed seeing the 
 similarities and differences between Python and C#. Really liking how C# is strongly-typed just like Java. Really 
 made me relive the dreaded college projects that we were tasked with (but never allowed to post on GitHub due to 
 copyright infringement and code stealing).
