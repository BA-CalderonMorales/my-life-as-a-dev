# CSharpRefresher

This repo is to help with understanding basic/advanced c# concepts. Feel free to create a PR to update any part that seems off.
I primarily use this for myself, but really anyone can piggyback off of this repo for their own benefit.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* Visual Studio 2019 or 2020
* Preferred Windows 10 or higher OS (haven't tested on earlier versions)

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ git clone <CSharpRefresher repo https url>
$ locate where you recently cloned the project to
$ find the solution file associated with the project.
$ double click the solution file (e.g. Fundamentals.sln)
$ open the Program.cs file within visual studio.
$ uncomment the specific lesson you would like a refresher on.
```

## Usage

This is a simple console application. Should be something you can easily clone locally and run the Program.cs file.
If you have issues running the console app, feel free to message me. I can update this readme based off findings from
our conversation, if necessary.

### Branches

* Develop

## Additional Documentation and Acknowledgments

* FreeCodeCamp tutorials
* PluralSight modules
