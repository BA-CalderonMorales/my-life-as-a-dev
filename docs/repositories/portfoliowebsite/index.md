# repo_PersonalSite
<h1>Notes</h1><br><br>
<p>Update to personal website to hold portfolio information. Contains some usage of Bootstrap 5. (6/1/2021)</p><br><br>
<p>Refactored code to look more minimal. Still needs more work. Upcoming releases will include additional content added onto projects section. (8/2/2021)</p><br><br>
<p>Refactored projects section due to bug on IOS view of portfolio site. Realized that users visiting my page can't view my projects within the modal on IOS devices. Verified this by checking the site on my phone! Changed project section to a carousel to test whether this is a problem with using carousel's from bootstrap 5 too. (8/8/2021).</p>
