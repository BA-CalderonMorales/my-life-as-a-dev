# Music_Library
In this repository, I'm finding out how to use Django REST Framework, in conjunction with Postman to see how queries can be handled in a more straightforward fashion. Unlike my Trash Collector Project, this Django project is showing me how Django REST Framework is handling the way that data is created, read, updated, and deleted.

______

Upon completion of this project, I'll be uploading my JSON api collection to show what all I completed as far as Postman method testing.

______

All documents have been uploaded, project is in working order.
