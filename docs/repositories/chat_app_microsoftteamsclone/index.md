# Chatt-App-MicrosoftTeamsClone

The tutorial I followed in order to create the chat app portion of my capstone project was created by the channel: JavaScript Mastery.
Here is the video in case you want to create a chat app (without all the modifications that I made to it). It details, step by step, what is necessary to create a chat app 
using the Chat Engine api. It was really fun completing the chat app, and I highly recommend checking it out for yourself!

# Deployed Site
I managed to deploy my site using Netlify, so I'm going to be working on there, along with localhost:3000 in order to try and get my site as functional as I possibly can.
https://brandino-sites.netlify.app/

In order to login to the site, you'll need to enter the following credentials to login as a visitor: <br><br>

username: userOne<br>
password: 123123 <br><br>

or<br><br>

username: userTwo<br>
password: 123123

I'm going to hold off on allowing capability to login as a master since the site is already deployed. So if you want to see what all a master account can do, you'll need to 
look at the tutorial and try to get those features down yourself. Here's to life-long learning!

In order to logout, for now at least, you'll need to go into your local storage (once logged in) and clear what is currently in there -> refresh the page, and you'll return back to the sign in page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
