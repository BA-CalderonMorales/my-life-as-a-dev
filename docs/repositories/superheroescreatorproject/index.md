# SuperheroesCreator
In this project, I'm using Django to help me build my database for the project. The intention behind this project is to get my feet wet with using Django and how it's used in conjunction with Python, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap. Another key concept that I'm coming to understand as I'm coming near completing this project is that CRUD is a fundamentally, powerful tool for someone to know. With this web app, I'm sure that I only touched the tip of the iceberg, but I feel pretty proud of myself for getting MySQL to function alongside with Python. I'm about 70% finished with this project (6/29/2021). I'll try and update here once more when I'm finished with the design aspects of the web app.

## Well, I couldn't get the server to deploy on GitHub pages, but I got some snippets below of what it looks like!

/// The text below is what I was trying to do before deploying the site. ///

It's about 11:55 pm at the time of me posting this message (6/29): I was unable to successafully add images of superheroes onto my webpage today. Will be attempting to put some images on there tomorrow. Either way, this has been quite the learning experience. I learned how Django interacts with different IDEs, Python, MySQL, HTML5/CSS, and Bootstrap. This project was extremely fun to do, and overall, I believe that I've learned quite a few new tricks from this experience! Looking forward to being 100% done with this project (tomorrow)!

QUICK DISCLAIMER: I intended to showcase how my project looks here on GitHub, but I was only able to post my README file ðŸ˜‚. I'll be trying to fix this tomorrow morning, too. Cheers!

Update: 07-08-2021
On what was happening with my GitHub pages:

In order to view this project, you would need to make sure to clone the repository, create your own MySQL database, and migrate all of your settings from the current project that you've cloned to your MySQL database. Once your settings have been migrated, you would be able to run the program by going into the PyCharm terminal and entering: 

python manage.py runserver

One caviat: You need to make sure that you are in the correct directory in order to run the proegram. In my projects that followed this one, I'm going to attempt to make it so that anyone can view my Django project on GitHub pages. It will be a little bit of a journey, but I think it will help me see where I can get with publishing web apps on here!
