# Personal-Site-CSS-No-Bootstrap

DISCLAIMER: Please see my up-to-date Portfolio Site here: https://ba-calderonmorales.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/

I kept this repo up to see how I've progressed in my styling. I'll be doing the same with the Portfolio Site once I decide to revamp my portfolio site.
Gotta always own up to where we came from as software developers. This PersonalSite with no bootstrap was meant to keep me humble for the decades to come.

I created this website using both what I've leared from the tutorials on Udemy.com,
 as well as the applying what I've learned so far from devCodeCamp.

I've updated some of the code to coincide with devCodeCamp style. File paths were main issue. Currently attempting to populate images to the live webpage. Will be updating Projects section as I create more and more projects.


_It's been a while since this repo was updated._
