# AI Integration Demo

This page demonstrates how to use the AI-powered content generation features of this documentation platform.

## Setup

Before using the AI features, you need to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. Create an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) if you don't have one already
2. Generate an API key in your OpenAI dashboard
3. Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Windows (Command Prompt)
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

!!! warning
    Never commit your API key to version control or share it publicly.

## AI Content Generation

The following sections demonstrate how AI can enhance documentation writing:

### Generate Summary

You can use the AI to generate summaries of your content:

<!-- This is a placeholder for AI-generated content -->
<div class="ai-placeholder" data-command="generate_summary" data-content="...above content...">
  [Summary will appear here once the AI plugin is fully implemented]
</div>

### Code Examples

You can generate code examples based on descriptions:

<!-- This is a placeholder for AI-generated content -->
<div class="ai-placeholder" data-command="generate_code" data-language="python" data-description="a function that calculates Fibonacci sequence">
  [Code example will appear here once the AI plugin is fully implemented]
</div>

## Coming Soon

In future versions, we plan to implement:

- Interactive prompting through a UI component
- Secure API key storage in browser's localStorage
- Inline content editing with AI suggestions

## How It Works

Under the hood, this feature uses:

1. A custom MkDocs plugin (`ai_plugin.py`)
2. OpenAI's API for content generation
3. Jinja templates and HTML components to display the results

Stay tuned for more advanced features in upcoming releases!
