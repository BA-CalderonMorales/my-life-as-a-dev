<!-- 
This page serves as both documentation and a functional demonstration 
of the AI plugin capabilities. The placeholders will be replaced with 
actual AI-generated content when the page is built with a valid OpenAI API key.

# AI Integration Demo

This page demonstrates how to use the AI-powered content generation features of this documentation platform.

## Setup

<!-- 
The following section provides step-by-step instructions for setting up
the API key. This is required for the AI features to work properly.
-->

Before using the AI features, you need to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. Create an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) if you don't have one already
2. Generate an API key in your OpenAI dashboard
3. Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Windows (Command Prompt)
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

!!! warning "Security Alert"
    Never commit your API key to version control or share it publicly.

## AI Content Generation

<!-- 
The following sections showcase the different AI capabilities built into this documentation.
Each section contains a placeholder that will be processed by the AI plugin.
-->

The following sections demonstrate how AI can enhance documentation writing:

### Generate Summary

<!-- 
This placeholder will be replaced with an AI-generated summary of the content above.
The data-command attribute specifies what action the AI plugin should take.
The data-content attribute provides the source material for the summary.
-->

You can use the AI to generate summaries of your content:

<!-- This is a placeholder for AI-generated content -->
<div class="ai-placeholder" data-command="generate_summary" data-content="...above content...">
  [Summary will appear here once the AI plugin is fully implemented]
</div>

### Code Examples

<!-- 
This placeholder demonstrates code generation capabilities.
The data-language attribute specifies which programming language to use,
while the data-description provides instructions for the AI.
-->

You can generate code examples based on descriptions:

<!-- This is a placeholder for AI-generated content -->
<div class="ai-placeholder" data-command="generate_code" data-language="python" data-description="a function that calculates Fibonacci sequence">
  [Code example will appear here once the AI plugin is fully implemented]
</div>

## Coming Soon

<!-- 
This roadmap section helps users understand the planned enhancements.
It's valuable to communicate future development direction.
-->

In future versions, we plan to implement:

- Interactive prompting through a UI component
- Secure API key storage in browser's localStorage
- Inline content editing with AI suggestions

## How It Works

<!-- 
This technical section explains the underlying implementation
to help developers understand the architecture.
-->

Under the hood, this feature uses:

1. A custom MkDocs plugin (`ai_plugin.py`)
2. OpenAI's API for content generation
3. Jinja templates and HTML components to display the results

Stay tuned for more advanced features in upcoming releases!

<!-- 
To add your own AI-generated content, you can create placeholders with the following structure:
<div class="ai-placeholder" data-command="[command_type]" data-[parameter]="[value]">
  [Fallback content if AI generation fails]
</div>

Available commands:
- generate_summary: Summarizes provided content
- generate_code: Creates code examples based on descriptions
