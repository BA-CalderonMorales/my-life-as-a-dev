=== "AI"

    Are you an AI enthusiast like me? I've been having a blast exploring how AI can be integrated into documentation and in creating interactive tools. 

    To learn more about my journey and what the AI Playground offers, you can start with the [AI Introduction page](./ai-demo.md). It sets the stage for the tools and experiments I've been working on.

    If you're eager to jump right in and experience it firsthand, head directly to the [AI Playground](./ai-playground/index.md)! This is where the magic happens, and you can find tools like:
    
    *   **Repository Explorer**: Get AI-driven insights into code repositories.
    *   **Interactive Scene Creator**: Describe and generate 3D scenes with AI assistance.
    *   **Code Assistance**: Leverage AI to explain, document, or help refactor your code.

    !!! info "Experimenting with AI & Test Scenes"
        You'll also find some of my visual experiments and test scenes (often generated with AI assistance) in the [Test Scenes section of my blog](./blog/life/test_scenes/). It's a fun way I explore prompting and share visual concepts.
