## Summary

I bridge military precision with software innovation, bringing a distinctive approach to engineering challenges.

Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, mentoring junior developers, or architecting distributed systems, I focus on building resilient, scalable solutions that integrate both human and technical factors. Passionate about democratizing development environments and streamlining workflows, I use my experience to create accessible, efficient open-source tools.
