# AI Capabilities Evolved: Introducing the AI Playground!

This page previously demonstrated basic AI-powered content generation features. We've since launched a comprehensive **AI Playground** where you can explore these capabilities and much more in an interactive environment!

## Welcome to the AI Playground

The new [AI Playground](./ai-playground/playground/index.md) is your central hub for:

-   **Repository Exploration**: Get AI-driven insights into code repositories.
-   **Interactive Scene Creation**: Describe and generate 3D scenes with AI assistance.
-   **Code Assistance**: Leverage AI to explain, document, or help refactor your code.

## What Happened to the Old Demos?

The functionalities previously showcased here (like AI-generated summaries and code examples via placeholders) have been integrated and significantly enhanced within the new AI Playground. This allows for a more dynamic and user-friendly experience.

### API Key Handling

Previously, this page included instructions for setting up your OpenAI API key. In the new AI Playground, API key management is designed to be handled securely on the server-side. You will not need to configure client-side API keys to use the playground on this site.

## How It Works (Now)

The AI Playground is built using:

1.  A custom MkDocs plugin (`ai_plugin.py`) and a dedicated web component (`<ai-playground>`).
2.  Backend services (which you would implement) to securely call OpenAI's API.
3.  Interactive HTML templates and JavaScript for a dynamic user experience.

We encourage you to explore the [AI Playground](./ai-playground/playground/index.md) to see these features in action!
